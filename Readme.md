# 🛒 Ecommerce URL Generator & Scraper (Streamlit App)

A Python web app built with **Streamlit** that uses **GPT-4** to generate real product URLs from ecommerce platforms like **Amazon**, **Flipkart**, **Daraz**, and more. It then scrapes essential product data — including title, category (men/women), price, and description — using **Playwright** and **BeautifulSoup**.
